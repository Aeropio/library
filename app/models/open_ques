email, :phone_number, :first_name, :identity_number are kept uniq, how can DOB be uniq??????/
from where he uploads identity number??/

if user had library card before then does it mean that library card had expriry date and he wants to renew the same card ?

User Entry Screen (based on the form) with ID Card Upload.- id number like SSN(Social security number)????

when admin approves then we need to assign a uniq library card  to that user ?
if he doesnot approve then we do not create a new library card for that user, also should we remove the user from the database?

notify the user:- does it mean to send a mail to user stating if its approved or not , and if approved then the library card number also needs to be send in the mail


Admin Screen
 - Pending Approval views  screen 
    once user signs up and submit the application , it goes in Pending approval views screen, for each application, admin has 2 buttons approve and reject, if approved then a library card is assigned to that user and approved user(application) is removed from that screen
    if application is rejected then that application should be removed from the screen?

Please make a table for Form (David will share) fields. Create View for the form and make sure to validate the data and give appropriate error messages...
